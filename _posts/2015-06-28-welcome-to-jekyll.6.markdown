This post is inspired by readings from [An Eternal Golden Braid] from the author [Douglas Hofstadter].

Alot has been made in the past few years about the concerns for artificial intelligence [turning us into pets] or [taking all our jobs].
 These concerns are fueled by some particularly big names in science and technology like Stephen Hawkings, Elon Musk, Raymond Kurzweil, Richard Stallman and many more.
 I believe there is a disconnect between what we believe today's AI can do and what these people fear it could.
 
 
1. <strong>Respond to situations flexibly</strong>
2. <strong>Take advantage of fortuitous circumstances</strong>
3. <strong>Make sense of ambiguous and contradictory information</strong>
4. <strong>Recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation</strong>
5. <strong>Find similarities between situations despite differences that may seperate them</strong>
6. <strong>Synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways </strong>
7. <strong>Come up with ideas that are novel</strong>
