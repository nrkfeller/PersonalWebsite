<hr>

My name is Nick Feller, I'm a computer programmer from Montreal, Canada. I grew up in a suburb in the middle of nowhere called Mont-Saint-Hilaire, QC. My parents are both imigrants. My dad is Swiss-German from 
Worb, a small town in Bern. My mom is Chinese-Japanese born in Taipei and grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazi. They speak 12 languages between the two of them.

Currently working at Ericsson in Montreal, I develop Internet of Things products. The main tools I have worked with are Rails, Apache Spark, Cloud9IDE, Git, Ubuntu, and among others.

Aside from programming, research and developing products. I'm a huge basketball fan, I love to go camping and playing the guitar.
